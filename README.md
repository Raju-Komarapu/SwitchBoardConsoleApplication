# SwitchBoard Simulator

A C# console application that simulates a real-world electrical switchboard. Each switch controls a specific appliance (like a bulb, fan, or AC) using the State design pattern. The application demonstrates object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and design patterns.

**Features**
-	Simulate a switchboard with multiple switches and appliances.
-	Each switch is tightly coupled to a single appliance.
-	Appliances can be turned ON or OFF using their respective switches.
- Extensible: Easily add new appliance types or states.
-	Clean separation of concerns and encapsulation.

**Design Patterns Used**
-	State Pattern: Manages appliance ON/OFF states.
-	Factory Pattern: Centralizes appliance creation.
-	Encapsulation: Appliances are only accessible via switches.
